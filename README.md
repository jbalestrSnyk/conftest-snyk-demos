# Conftest Snyk Demos

The following demos show how to use [conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/) with Snyk to break builds based on certain conditions.

Conftest is a utility to help you write tests against structured configuration data. For instance, you could write tests for your Kubernetes configurations, Tekton pipeline definitions, Terraform code, Serverless configs or any other structured data. In this case we are using JSON return result set from a snyk container, open-source and code test

## Pre Requistes

* [Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/install-or-update-the-snyk-cli) 
* Maven to build the required source code example in order to run a snyk test
* [conftest](https://www.conftest.dev/)
